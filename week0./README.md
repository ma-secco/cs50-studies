# Week 0 - Harvard CS50

### Creating a project with Scratch.

This project is the first assignment from the CS50 course, focused on introducing programming concepts in a easy and funny way. 

The project should include some requirements, such as conditionals, loops and variables. To attend the prerequisites of the task, I came up with a game called "the Jellyfish game", in which the player must use the arrow keys in his board to fulfill the goal and win the game.  
When the assignment was submited, it attented all the requirements and achieved the score of 8/8.
